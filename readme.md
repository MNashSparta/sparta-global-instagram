# Instagram Sign-up Clone

## Summary


This is a non-functional clone of the Instagram sign-up page.

The aim of the project was to implement responsive CSS to create as close a clone as possible, that works across different devices.

This was homework set over day 1 and 2 of the Sparta Global training.

## Design

* The image of a phone should be removed when the screen size becomes too small.

* Once the image is removed, the sign-up form should remain consistently in the centre of the page.

* The footer width should adjust to accommodate all the links by moving into new rows when necessary.

* The form and footer should not adjust to become too small to read when narrowed.
